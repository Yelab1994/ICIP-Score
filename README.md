# iMLGAM: integrated Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithm-driven Multiomics analysis for pan-Cancer immunotherapy response prediction

## Overview

This repository contains data and code related to the study of predictive models for pan-cancer immunotherapy. The purpose of this study is to construct a signature based on RNA sequencing data to predict the outcomes of immunotherapy in patients with pan-cancer.

## Directory Structure

- `Figure1`, `Figure2`, ...: Data and original code for saving generated figures.
- The source code of the iMLAGA package.
